# Flask-Heroku-430L-Render

This repo has been used as a backend for a university project at AUB, for the EECE430L course project.
It is built on top of the Python-based framework Flask.

# Reproducing the development environment

This repo includes a `requirements.txt` file. It is conventionnally used with the Python package manager `pip` to enumerate and install the dependencies of a codebase. 
Use it as follows:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running the code

This repo includes 2 branches: `main` and `heroku`. Both are identical in features and functionnalities. However, `main` can be used on the local machine but is not deployable on Heroku, and `heroku` can be deployed on Heroku.
